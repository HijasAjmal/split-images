# Split image

these scripts can be used as extension for gThumb image viewer
for spliting the image into two halves, and convert them to grayscale.
I am using this to convert my pdf notes to kindle friendly dimensions.

### split.sh
splits all images in a path
Usage: splip.sh path/

### split_file.sh
split selected images
Usage: splip.sh path/ filename.jpg
